## Hello Everyone!

**Welcome to my GitHub page!**

I am a senior year computer science student at Washington State University in Pullman, Washington State.

I put great interest in developing fullstack application, and I do enjoy working in team-environment.

I often do side projects to learn new techstack on my free time.
