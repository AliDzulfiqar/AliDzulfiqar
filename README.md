## Hello Everyone!

**Welcome to my GitHub page!**

I am a senior year computer science student at Washington State University in Pullman, Washington State.

I put great interest in developing fullstack application, and I do enjoy working in team-environment.

I usually do side projects off-school and learn new techstack on my free time.

As of now, I'm currently investing my time in learning AWS and other cloud service providers.
